<div class="e-content flow">
<p>This is not a bucket list. These are just a handful of things that haven’t happened for me yet, and perhaps some things I will never get around to. Never say never, though.</p>
<h2 id="never-been-on-a-cruise-ship">Never been on a cruise ship <a class="direct-link" href="#never-been-on-a-cruise-ship">#</a></h2>
<p>When I was nineteen or twenty I read the <a href="https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf">David Foster Wallace essay</a>, later republished as <i>A Supposedly Fun Thing I Will Never Do Again</i>. My grandparents were not cruise ship people, my parents were not cruise ship people, and I am not a cruise ship person. I know I’d be one of the constantly seasick ones. The idea of having to eat at an assigned dinner table with the same random strangers for a whole week turns me off. I like spontaneous fun, not organized fun. Any time I think I do entertain the idea, I Google 'cruise ship disasters' for <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/02/14/the-eight-worst-cruise-ship-disasters">good reminders</a> to keep my feet on dry land.</p>
<h2 id="never-been-to-a-disney-park">Never been to a Disney Park <a class="direct-link" href="#never-been-to-a-disney-park">#</a></h2>
<p>Along the same lines, my parents were not Disney People. At least, I think a Disney vacation was out of their price range when my sister and I were kids. I can name all the other theme parks (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flags_Great_Escape_and_Hurricane_Harbor">Great Escape</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flags_Darien_Lake">Six Flags</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada%27s_Wonderland">Canada’s Wonderland</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_Forest_Water_Safari">Enchanted Forest/Water Safari</a>) in upstate New York and Canada we visited during our summer vacations. I have heard that visiting a Disney Park is the <a href="https://uxreactor.com/disney-pioneered-modern-experience-design/">ultimate designed experience</a>, though, so maybe I should plan to go as an adult. You know, for UX <em>research purposes</em>.</p>
<h2 id="never-been-to-florida-(since-airports-don%E2%80%99t-count)">Never been to Florida (since airports don’t count) <a class="direct-link" href="#never-been-to-florida-(since-airports-don%E2%80%99t-count)">#</a></h2>
<p>Continuing a theme from the previous list item, I have never visited the sunshine state. My wife has though, as a resident at Florida State’s <a href="https://artsresearch.fsu.edu/">Facitlity for Arts Research</a> a few years ago. I would love to see Miami, so this is one list item I might cross off in my lifetime. At the same time, I have familiarized myself with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Man">Florida Man meme</a>. Residing in Tennessee, I might be as geographically close to Florida and the Florida Men as I’m comfortable with.</p>
<h2 id="never-used-uber-or-lyft">Never used Uber or Lyft <a class="direct-link" href="#never-used-uber-or-lyft">#</a></h2>
<p>I’m not a fan of these kind of companies and their labor practices. Again, there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/business/uber-lyft-driver-deaths.html">horror stories</a>, but my primary concern has always been that your rideshare driver might not be carrying the right kind of insurance coverage before you get in their car. I have an airport taxi service I use in Knoxville, and it’s OK, and probably comes out to a similar price. At the same time I have stayed at Airbnbs a couple times, so you can call me a huge hypocrite.</p>
<h2 id="never-invested-in-cryptocurrencies">Never invested in cryptocurrencies <a class="direct-link" href="#never-invested-in-cryptocurrencies">#</a></h2>
<p>And I probably won’t. I’m a somewhat technical guy, and the blockchain technology just doesn’t interest me. Nor do the economics make sense to me. I do watch from the sidelines though, reading Molly White’s blog <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/">web3 is going just great</a>. I’ll stick with my get rich slow scheme (graphic design).</p>
<h2 id="never-read-a-malcolm-gladwell-book">Never read a Malcolm Gladwell book <a class="direct-link" href="#never-read-a-malcolm-gladwell-book">#</a></h2>
<p>This one seems kind of braggy, or at best trivial. I remember Malcolm Gladwell being all the rage ten or twelve years ago, and I still have not picked up one of his bestselling nonfiction books. I don’t have anything personally against the man, but I’m familiar with the <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2013/10/malcolm-gladwell-critique-david-and-goliath-misrepresents-the-science.html">criticism of his work</a>. I got burned by a similar writer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Lehrer">Jonah Lehrer</a>, who probably committed <a href="http://www.edrants.com/how-jonah-lehrer-recycled-his-own-material-for-imagine/">worse crimes</a> against popular nonfiction than Gladwell.</p>
<h2 id="never-bought-a-television">Never bought a television <a class="direct-link" href="#never-bought-a-television">#</a></h2>
<p>I grew up with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a> in my bedroom, using an 11-inch television for a monitor. This meant I grew up with a television in my bedroom. It gave me an appreciation for 1990s pop culture and probably helped me relate to my peers. In college and beyond I always relied on my roommates to supply the TV. I had a microwave oven and a vacuum cleaner. When I started living on my own, I never prioritized having a television. Today I have a laptop and access to a couple streaming services, so I do watch TV. There are times when I think it would be nice to watch something on a larger screen, but I’m also glad our living room is not dominated by one. Maybe someday we’ll invest in a projector.</p>
